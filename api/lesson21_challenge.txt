# Your EI Operating System: Building the Compass

## Creating Your Personal EI Compass

*15-20 minutes to build your guide*

This becomes your one-page operating system for emotional intelligence. Keep it visible — it's your quick reference under pressure.

## Practice Drills: Choose Your Training

*10-15 minutes to practice*

Select TWO drills based on your lowest pillars:

### Drill 1: Body Scan & Label (Self-Awareness + Regulation)
*If these are your weak points, start here*

<body-scan-drill>
</body-scan-drill>

### Drill 2: If-Then Builder (Self-Regulation)
*Pre-load your responses to known triggers*

### Drill 3: LRL Micro (Empathy + Social Skills)
*Practice the Listen-Reflect-Label sequence*

## Your 7-Day Practice Plan

Based on your assessment and chosen drills:

### Daily Minimums (5-10 minutes total):
1. **STOP Log:** Use STOP once, log the situation and outcome
2. **Values Metric:** Track your 3 micro-metrics from the Values Map
3. **Pillar Practice:** One drill targeting your lowest pillar

### Weekly Review (10 minutes on Day 7):
- Count total STOP uses
- Calculate average stress reduction (pre → post)
- Note one situation where EI changed the outcome
- Identify next week's focus based on what you learned

## The Accountability Framework

**Share your commitment:** Text someone these three things:
1. Your lowest pillar score
2. The one behavior you're practicing
3. Your daily tracking metric

**Their only job:** Ask you once on Day 4: "How's your [behavior] practice going?"

That's it. Simple accountability doubles follow-through.

## Red Flag Moments to Practice

Look for these situations to apply your EI tools:
- Email that makes you angry → STOP before responding
- Meeting where you're interrupted → Use LRL
- Deadline pressure → Run 90-second reset
- Criticism received → Name feeling, identify need
- Conflict arising → Propose micro-test with metric

## Progress Markers

You'll know you're improving when:
- Response gap increases (pause before reacting)
- Recovery time decreases (return to baseline faster)
- Precision increases (more specific than "fine" or "stressed")
- Options expand (see multiple responses, not just one)
- Influence grows (others calm in your presence)

## The Integration Challenge

**This week's mission:** Use your lowest pillar skill once per day in a real situation.
- Monday: Notice it's missing
- Tuesday: Attempt it awkwardly
- Wednesday: Refine based on yesterday
- Thursday: Try in a harder situation
- Friday: Combine with another tool
- Weekend: Reflect and adjust

## Exit Commitment

Complete these statements:
1. "My lowest pillar is **[pillar name]** with a score of **__/30**."
2. "The specific behavior I'm practicing is **[behavior]**, measured by **[metric]**."
3. "I'll know I'm improving when **[specific observable outcome]**."
4. "My accountability partner is **[name]** and they'll check on **[day]**."

## Homework for Next Lesson

**Bring to Lesson 3:**
- Your completed STOP logs (minimum 3)
- Your lowest pillar and one real trigger you faced
- One question about applying EI when you're already overwhelmed

**Bonus challenge:** Teach someone the difference between two of the five pillars. Teaching consolidates learning.
