They move toward something measurable."}, {"id": 5, "question": "Which tool pairs with the Social Skills pillar?", "type": "multiple_choice", "options": ["SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) with a clear request", "Only deep breathing", "Multitasking harder", "Avoiding direct statements"], "correct_answer": "SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) with a clear request", "explanation": "Social Skills use structured communication like SBI feedback paired with specific, dated requests. This creates clarity while maintaining relationships."}, {"id": 6, "question": "The 200-millisecond gap refers to:", "type": "multiple_choice", "options": ["How long you should pause before speaking", "The delay between amygdala activation and prefrontal cortex engagement", "The time it takes to calm down", "How long emotions last"], "correct_answer": "The delay between amygdala activation and prefrontal cortex engagement", "explanation": "Your amygdala (alarm) fires in 50ms, but your prefrontal cortex (executive function) takes 250ms. That 200ms gap is when emotions run unopposed \u2014 EI training helps manage this gap."}, {"id": 7, "question": "If your Baseline Assessment total is 75/140, the recommendation is:", "type": "multiple_choice", "options": ["You're beyond help", "Focus on your strengths only", "Target your lowest pillar with 1 drill per day", "Try to fix everything at once"], "correct_answer": "Target your lowest pillar with 1 drill per day", "explanation": "Scores of 71-105 indicate 'developing' level.
